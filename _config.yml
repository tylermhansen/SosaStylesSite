  about_text: Every bride deserves a stylist who is as invested in the vision as
    they are. After graduating from Lowell Academy, I brought my shears home to
    Standish, Maine, where I’ve been crafting custom looks at Tangles Hair
    Salon. I am a dual-licensed stylist in Maine and Massachusetts, which means
    I’m always on the move, bringing luxury bridal hair to women across New
    England. For me, it’s about more than just the perfect curl; it’s about the
    confidence you feel when you step into your dress. I can’t wait to help you
    find your "Sosa Studio" look.
