  Every bride deserves a stylist who is as invested in the vision as they are.
  After graduating from Lowell Academy, I brought my shears home to Standish,
  Maine, where I’ve been crafting custom looks at Tangles Hair Salon. I am a
  dual-licensed stylist in Maine and Massachusetts, which means I’m always on
  the move, bringing luxury bridal hair to women across New England. For me,
  it’s about more than just the perfect curl; it’s about the confidence you feel
  when you step into your dress. I can’t wait to help you find your "Sosa
  Studio" look.
